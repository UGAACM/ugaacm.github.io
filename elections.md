So you want to be an officer?
==============
Being involved in ACM can be a very rewarding experience. It's good for networking, meeting new people, and it looks good on a resume. ACM officers take that commitment to the next level. Officers maintain and improve our organization. As an officer, you'll be planning meetings and communicating with professors and companies to reach our goals.


#####What you need to know

Our next meeting (April 3rd) is going to be dedicated to this election. If you're running for a position, you'll have a chance to come introduce yourself, and tell us why you are running and why you would be a good candidate. We'll then hold elections via online polls for the next week, and the winnners will then be briefed on everything they need to know.

The first thing you need to do is to fill out [this form](http://ugaacm.com/nominate) to nominate yourself. After that, just come to Thursday meeting and speak earnestly about why you want to be an officer.

Best of luck to those who run!
