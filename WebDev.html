<h1>Web Dev Group</h1>
<h3>General Description</h3>
<p>The Web Development small group at the ACM is a targeted course aimed at showcasing key web development frameworks such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, C#, and ASP.NET as well as building the necessary skills to create and publish your own websites with key emphasis on the .NET MVC framework. Members will participate in building these skills through a comprehensive course and final project culminating in the construction of a basic, custom social media web site. We will work through various planned projects throughout the semester, though novel project ideas are welcome and encouraged!
<p>The group meets Wednesdays at 7:00 PM Boyd Room 328.
Until that time an email will be sent out with the meeting details, and you can check the ACM Calendar at <a href="http://ugaacm.com/calendar.html">here</a>.</p>
