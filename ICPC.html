What it is?
-----------
The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest is a competition of solving programming problems. The UGA-ACM has a sub-group that meets regularly in the fall. 

Goals
-------
The goals of the UGA-ACM ICPC are to help anyone that joins become more proficient at programming and to be successful in the competitive programming competitons we attend.

Team
-----
The team you make must consist of three people, no more, no less. It is best if you form teams based on programming language and skill level.

Competition
-------------
We attend the regional ICPC competition. As well as the ICPC we have other competitions we are making plans to attend.

The ICPC regional competition is held at Georgia Tech and the environment you program in is quite different from the normal computer lab or home desktop you're used to. Programming at the competition is exhilarating! You are comfortably put in a lecture hall filled with competitors and given a single laptop (shared amongst the team) to program on.
