Yesterday, we had casual night, where we take a step back and just relax, have fun, and get to know each other some more! Our spotlight event was an epic one-on-one Super Smash Bros Tournament. A whopping 23 people participated, and one champion emerged: Uri Smiley. Congratulations to Uri on this impressive accomplishment! Check out the tournament bracket to see how it all unfolded!
