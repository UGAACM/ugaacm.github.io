Hi everyone! We're back and ready to get this new semester started. We're hope you're as excited as we are.

If this is your first time here, welcome! This is the new website for the UGA chapter of the ACM, but you probably already knew that. We're basically the Computer Science club of the University of Georgia. We do everything from tech talks, and game nights, to having companies come to give talks and recruit.

As far as upcoming events go, we will have our first meeting next Thursday at 5 PM in Boyd 201. Our goal is to orient new members, show off our small groups and catalogue what we have planned for the rest of the semester. We have a lot of exciting events coming up that we'll announce at our meeting.

Some things to look forward to are a "What I Wish I Knew Before I Was Senior" talk. We have plans for game nights, resume workshops, development and tech talks. If it's CS related, you can find it here.

If you are interested, are an intro level CS major, or are just curious about us, you are welcome to come to our first meeting next Thursday at 5 PM in Boyd 201. We hope to see you there!
