Tonight, we had a talk by Jordan Burke on the topic of security with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [HIPAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act). [Jordan Burke](https://twitter.com/pendragondev) is the Chief Technical Officer at [VitaminC](http://getvitaminc.com/). He talked about Ruby on Rails, which is a framework made for the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to build modern web applications and sites, and how it relates to HIPAA, the "standard" in maintaining medical records.

You can view the slides from his presentation [here](http://vc-rails-security.herokuapp.com/). In addition ~~to being undercover FBI agent Burt Macklin~~, Jordan teaches the [Rails class at Four Athens](http://fourathens.com/railscode), organizes [Developers of Athens](http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Athens-Area-Software-Developers/) meetups the first Tuesday of every month, and supports women in technology through [Athens Women in Tech](http://athenswomenintech.com) (February 10) and [Rails Girls Athens](http://railsgirlsathens.com) (April 10 - 11).
