Hi everyone!

To start the New Year we've launched a new website for the University of Georgia's Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery.

We hope this website will become your stop for all information regarding our club.

I would also like to welcome our new officers to the club. They are:

President: Christopher Ghyzel\\
Vice President: Anurag Banerjee\\
PR & Webmaster: Jaicob Stewart\\
Treasurer: Craig Butler\\
Secretary: Chan Jong

They'll be with us for 6 months after which we will switch to a Fall-Spring election cycle.

Have a happy new year, and we look forward to seeing you all when school starts back!
