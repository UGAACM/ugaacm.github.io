author: Chris Ghyzel

Hi everyone. We have resume reviews / mock interviews with State Farm set up for this Thursday in Boyd 409. (That is the lounge on the 4th floor).

There will be IT professionals from State Farm there to help you, and being IT professionals themselves they know what to look for and what to improve.

I would highly recommend you sign up if you have never done a technical interview before. It is especially important to get your resume reviewed if you will be going to the Spring Career fair next week.

To signup just go to <a href="ugaacm.com/statefarm">ugaacm.com/statefarm</a>. I hope you decide to participate, and good luck!
