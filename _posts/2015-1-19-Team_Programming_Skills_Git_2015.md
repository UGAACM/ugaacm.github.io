Hey guys!

The title of the talk this week is "Team Programming Skills." And this refers to the skills that you will need to 
develop software collaboratively on a real team. Throughout your time here in the CS department you will gain vast
knowledge of programming languages, architecture, algorithms and a plathera of other things. However, one thing that 
is lacking are skills such as team communcations, task managment, issue tracking, shipping to production, and ofcourse 
the topic of todays talk, version control.

For this week we have chosen to do a crash course on how to use git version control to improve your ability to 
collaboratively write software. We've choosen version control first because it is arguable the most important and 
definitely the most applicable. Additionally many people are often initially intimidatd by git and its plethera of 
strange terminology and we hope to demistify some of that and "git" you on your way version controlling your code!

If we get a good response from this week, we will follow up with more talks about the other skills I have previously 
mentioned above so feel free to leave any feedback for us.
