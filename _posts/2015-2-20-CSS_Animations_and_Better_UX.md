For our meeting this week, Zach Saucier gave a presentation on CSS animations and improving UX. In case you missed it (or if you want to find out more), you can check out his slides [here](http://slides.com/zachsaucier/ma) and read his [intro tutorial on CSS animations](http://zachsaucier.com/blog/blog/2015/02/19/an-intro-to-web-animation/).

If you're interested in web development, our web development group is going to get started soon as well, so be on the lookout for that on our [calendar](http://ugaacm.com/calendar) and mailing list. There is another event related to design in development ("Transform Athens with Sean Reid") next Tuesday, Febrary 24, 2015 from 6PM to 8PM at The World Famous (351 N Hull St, Athens, GA).
